TODOS

- expand this web app to also be your personal budget tracker. after the transactions have been processed, we should then analyze it and do the same thign that your excel does.
- add fun charts and stuff- a dashboard.


THOUGHTS
- in the future, i want this project to be a docker thing people can install easilly. this way they can self host it and view it on their local network. it should all be open source code and give users the confidance to manage their finances and categorize their transactions with ease.
